      <h2>Founder of the Green Belt Movement:</h2>
      <p>
        Wangari Maathai, educated in the United States at Mount St. Scholastica College and the University of Pittsburgh, earned a Ph.D. at the University of Nairobi in 1971, becoming the first woman in East or Central Africa to earn a doctorate. After graduating, she began teaching in the Department of Veterinary Anatomy at the University of Nairobi.

        While working with the National Council of Women of Kenya, Maathai developed the idea that village women could improve the environment by planting trees to provide a fuel source and to slow the processes of deforestation and desertification. In 1977, she founded the Green Belt Movement, an organization that, by the early 21st century, had planted some 30 million trees. The movement's leaders established the Pan African Green Belt Network in 1986 to educate world leaders about conservation and environmental improvement, leading to similar initiatives in other African countries.

      <h2>Advocate for Human Rights and Women's Issues:</h2>
      <p>
        In addition to her conservation work, Maathai was a vocal advocate for human rights, AIDS prevention, and women's issues. She represented these concerns at meetings of the United Nations General Assembly. In 2002, she was elected to Kenya's National Assembly with 98 percent of the vote, and in 2003, she was appointed assistant minister of environment, natural resources, and wildlife.
      </p>
      <h2>Nobel Prize and Legacy:</h2>
      <p>
        Wangari Maathai's holistic approach to sustainable development, embracing democracy, human rights, and women's rights, earned her the Nobel Prize in 2004. She authored books such as "The Green Belt Movement: Sharing the Approach and the Experience" (1988) and her autobiography, "Unbowed" (2007). Maathai's contributions extended beyond her home country, and her work left a lasting impact on environmental conservation and social justice.
